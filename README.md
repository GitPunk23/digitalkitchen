## Project Description
This project was born from both an interest in learning new technologies (specifically the spring boot framework and learning tech stacks in general) as well as creating a management system for my partner and I's vast amount of recipes. This project connects with a MYSQL database used to hold information pertaining to recipes and allows the user to interact with them.
