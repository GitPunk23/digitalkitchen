## Project Description
This project was born from both an interest in learning new technologies (specifically the spring boot framework and learning tech stacks in general) as well as creating a management system for my partner and I's vast amount of recipes. This project connects with a MYSQL database used to hold information pertaining to recipes and allows the user to interact with them.

## Usage
### Create
The create functionality in the app allows the user to create a recipe with as many steps and ingredients needed, as well as a tagging system to find the recipe quickly later!

### Search/Browse/Edit
The application also allows full browsing of the database. The search can be filtered by any value in the recipe's record. Once a recipe is retrieved from the database it can also be fully edited to the user's content.
